# Test

Contributions to Hack Club are very welcome, and strongly encouraged (even to
this document)!

## Doing it

We use a modified version of
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) at Hack Club. The
only difference is instead of deploying from a reviewed pull request, we merge
first and deploy straight from master.

Part of the GitHub Flow is submitting pull requests. See
https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ for a good overview of
what pull requests are and how to use them. Internally, we use the _shared
repository model_ for collaborative development, though we encourage external
contributors to contribute through the _fork & pull model_.

When contributing, please pay attention to the commit format of other commits in
the repository.

### Style Guides

If a style guide exists for the language you're contributing in, please do the
maintainers of the repository a favor and follow it. If you notice anything that
deviates from our style guide, don't hesitate to submit a pull request to fix
it. It's very appreciated!

Our existing style guides:

- [Markdown](https://github.com/hackclub/meta/blob/master/markdown_style_guide.md)

## Naming conventions

### Branch names

Branch names should adhere to the following:

- All lowercase
- `-` as space separator for branch names
- If a feature branch, include the name of the feature

### File names

File names should follow the following guidelines:

- All lowercase
- `_` as space separator for file names
- `-` as a space separator for dates in file names
- Dates in `YY-MM-DD` format

## Git Commits

In order to ensure that our git history makes sense we have certain guidelines
which we require contributors to adhere to. These are:

### Commits should follow the commit standards

These are:

- Commits should be written in the imperative mood
- Commits should start with a capitol letter
- Commits should not end with a full sto

This is a style used by many other Open Source projects (Linux, Rails) as well
as most corporate software development shops.

[This is a great guide on writing a git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

#### Examples

> fix typo in introduction.

- Does **not** start with a capitol letter
- Ends with a full stop

> Added iron man gif

- Does **not** use the imperative mood

> Adding more pizza parlours to directory

- Does **not** use the imperative mood

> Fix typo in introduction to user guide

This commit message is wonderful!

### Commits should be one logically unit of change

A logical unit of change can be thought of as completion of a single task. A
good way to figure out if you are not adhereing to this rule is to tell yourself
what you changed ("I added a picture of a donkey to the twilio workshop"). If
you find yourself having multiple statements in this description then you have
made your commit too big.

#### Examples

> Add an image of pizza, fix typos, rewrite `README.md`

This commit message contains three units of change, they are:

- An image of pizza
- Fixed typos
- Rewritten `README.md`

These should be split into one commit each.

> Add an image of pizza

This commit is great as only one logical change was made.

### Commits should explain the change, but not be longer than 50 chars

A commit message is used for quickly summarising a change. Another contributor
should be able to read it, along with the content and immediately understand the
change does.

#### Examples

> Fix typo

- This commit message does not give any context

> Add the spark reactor source code into the document where we add our thoughts

- This commit message is too long! It should be less than 50 characters!
- It uses too many words and could be simplified

## Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub's built in issue tracker for nearly everything at Hack Club. We
recommend reading through https://guides.github.com/features/issues/ to get a
good idea of how to use GitHub Issues.

In addition to using vanilla GitHub Issues, we use kanban to manage our team's
workflow (see http://leankit.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/ for a good overview of
what kanban is). To do that with GitHub Issues, we use a neat tool called
[ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/) to organize our GitHub Issues on a kanban
board. If you go to any of our repos with ZenHub installed, you should see a
"Boards" button on the right sidebar, right under the "Code" button. If you
click it, you'll see our issues organized on a real-time kanban board.

## Getting to know git

If you aren't already familiar with git, here's a couple links we recommend
going through:

- Getting started: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
- Understanding git (important!): https://youtu.be/1ffBJ4sVUb4

## Labs

This section will cover any contribution guidelines specific to
[Labs](meta/labs) and any other club that would like to contribute.

### Contributing case studies

First make sure that you've read the
[`README` in the `case_studies` directory](case_studies/README.md).

#### Before club events

1. Follow steps 1 - 5 in the
   ["case study contribution walkthrough" section below](#case-study-contribution-walkthrough)
2. Find your club's folder (located inside of [`case_studies`](/case_studies))
3. Inside your club's folder, make sure that the event you are planning has its
   own folder (create one if it does not already exist)
4. Inside of this folder, make sure that there is a `planning.md` file (create
   one if it doesn't exist)
5. Within the `planning.md` file, include:
  - An outline of what's going to happen at the event or how a process might
    work and any associated planning done to make that event great.
  - A list of problems that you anticipate you might run into and how you might
    solve them
6. Follow steps 6 - 10 in the
   [case study contribution walkthrough](#case-study-contribution-walkthrough)

#### After club events

1. Follow steps 1 - 5 in the
   [case study contribution walkthrough](#case-study-contribution-walkthrough)
2. In the same event's folder as the `planning.md` file, make sure that there is
   a `recap.md` file (create one if it does not already exist).
3. Inside the `recap.md` file, answer the following questions:
    - What you end up doing during the event and how did it differ from the
      original plan?
    - What went well?
    - What didn't go well?
    - What tips do you have for other organizers?
    - _For example:_
      - Would you recommend doing or not doing what you did activity?
      - If you would recommend it, what might they watch out for?
      - Etc.
4. Follow steps 6 - 10 in the
   ["case study contribution walkthrough" section below](#case-study-contribution-walkthrough)

#### Case study contribution walkthrough

Below is the recommended contribution flow for submitting
[case studies](case_studies/).

1. Go to [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) and open your "hackclub" workspace.
2. Make sure that the email address associated with git is correct.

        $ git config user.email

   If the email shown does not **exactly** match the email you used to sign up
   to GitHub, reset it.

        $ git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

3. If you're not already on the `master` branch, switch to it.

        $ git checkout master

4. Update your Hack Club fork.

        $ git pull https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub.git

5. Create a new branch to add the case study to. Branch names should briefly
   describe the change being made. They should be lowercase and use dashes (`-`)
   instead of spaces. Since I'm adding the planning for our first meeting, I'm
   going to call this branch `add-first-meeting-planning`. We call this a
   feature branch.

        $ git checkout -b add-first-meeting-planning

6. Open up the file you want to modify for the case study and make any
   additions/modifications. In this case, I'm going to open
   `case_studies/lowell_high_school/2015-09-19_first_meeting/planning.md` and
   add some example planning to it (create a folder with a corresponding format
   if there isn't one already).

    ![Adding some planning](https://i.imgur.com/HbM24cp.gif)

7. Tell git to add all of your changes (make sure you've saved all of your
   files).

        $ git add --all

8. Let's tell git to make a commit with our changes and attach a message to the
   commit. Your message should reflect the change being made. In this case,
   we're going to set the message to "Add Lowell first meeting planning." Change
   the message appropriately.

        $ git commit -m "Add Lowell first meeting planning."

9. Push our branch with our changes to GitHub. Replace
   `add-first-meeting-planning` with your branch name. Git will prompt you for
   your GitHub username and password. When you start typing your password, it'll
   look like nothing is happening -- don't worry, git is getting all of your
   keystrokes and is hiding them for your privacy. Just hit enter when you're
   done.

        $ git push -u origin add-first-meeting-planning

10. Go to your `hackclub` fork on GitHub (it's at
    `https://github.com/{username}/hackclub`, mine is at
    https://github.com/zachlatta/hackclub). You should see the following:

    ![Recently pushed branches notification](https://i.imgur.com/NOeQyBe.png)

11. Click the green "Compare & pull request" button to create a new pull
    request. If appropriate, modify the title of the pull request and further
    describe your changes in the description. Once you're ready, click "Create a
    pull request".
12. And you're done! Not too bad, huh? The pull request I created is over at
    https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/pull/163.
